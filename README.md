Log your daily activity with Angular 5 & Node  - simple MEAN stack application example. Uses mongoDB (MongoLabs) with CRUD functionality. You can use this poject to build on top of it and create something bigger.

Working example of this app can be seen here (heroku): https://polar-oasis-59313.herokuapp.com/


To run, build backend & angular frontend and copy dist files to express '/static' folder; inside project folder run:

- npm install
- cd frontend
- npm install
- npm build 
- cd ..
- node app.js


When build, frontend files are copied to static folder, served by Express.
I plan on creating same projects with java backend (Spring Boot) on another branch of this repository: TO-DO
