Log your daily activity with Angular 5 & Node  - simple MEAN stack application example. Uses mongoDB (MongoLabs) with CRUD functionality. You can use this poject to build on top of it and create something bigger.

Working example off this app can be seen here (heroku): TO-DO

When build, frontend files are copied to static folder, served by Express.
I plan on creating same projects with java backend (Spring Boot) on another branch of this repository: TO-DO
